<br>
## TODO list:<br>
1. Load GDT in 32 bit code.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//Done! <br>
2. Load GDT in 64 bit code.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//Not yet but use GDT grub sets. <br>
3. Setup and enable 4-level paging in 32 bit mode, and then jump to 64 bit code.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//Done! <br>
4. Kernel virtual memery management.<br>
